# First Alert by Resideo API Documentation

This document describes the API used by the First Alert by Resideo mobile app to communicate with smoke/CO detectors.

## Authentication

The API uses **OAuth 2.0 with PKCE** via **Auth0**.

### OAuth Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Auth Domain | `login.resideo.com` |
| Client ID | `SRmiA7CaYi1JgivDZdzzoZu4X5VBogGt` |
| Audience | `https://resideo-prod.auth0.com/api/v2/` |
| Scopes | `openid profile email offline_access` |

### Token Refresh

Access tokens expire after 1 hour. Use the refresh token to get new access tokens:

```http
POST https://login.resideo.com/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "grant_type": "refresh_token",
  "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>",
  "client_id": "SRmiA7CaYi1JgivDZdzzoZu4X5VBogGt"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "id_token": "eyJ...",
  "scope": "openid profile email offline_access",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

## API Endpoints

Base URL: `https://api.ha.resideo.com`

> **Moved in Sept 2026.** The old base URL, `https://api.resideo.com`, is retired, not down —
> it now answers every call with a canned `{"statusCode":503,"message":"The API is
> temporarily down for planned maintenance."}`, indefinitely, regardless of Resideo's own
> status page (which shows no incident). Paths are unchanged at the new host; two extra
> headers are required on every call (see below). Confirmed live 2026-09-16. Credit:
> [sfcodes/ha-resideo v0.3.0](https://github.com/sfcodes/ha-resideo/releases/tag/v0.3.0),
> which mapped the same host move for Resideo's thermostat/leak-detector API surface.

POST /ds-activity-feed-api/api/v1/app/events
```

## Device Types

| `globalDeviceType` | `productFamily` | `productPlatform` | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `Citadel_SC5` | `SmokeDetector` | `Citadel` | First Alert Safe & Sound Smart Smoke/CO Alarm (SMCO600NVACA) |
| `LeakDetector_L1_R` | `LeakDetector` | `WLD3_RETAIL` | Water leak detector. Listed on the account but **not supported by this API**, see below |

### Devices without a state endpoint

An account can contain devices this API does not serve. Water leak detectors
appear in the `/accounts` response with full product metadata, but there is no
state endpoint for them on `ris-public-api`. Requesting their state from the
smoke detector endpoint returns:

```json
[{"ErrorCode":"DeviceNotInScaleUnit","Message":"DeviceId: ..."}]
```

Note the difference between the two 404 bodies, it is a useful signal:

- `{"statusCode":404,"message":"Resource not found"}` means the **path** does not
  exist. Every non smoke device collection tried (`leakDetectors`,
  `waterLeakDetectors`, `thermostats`, `waterValves`, and others, across `v1`,
  `v2` and `v3` and several service prefixes) returns this.
- `DeviceNotInScaleUnit` means the **path exists** but the device is served by a
  different backend.

Because of this, the integration filters devices by `productFamily` when reading
the account, so unsupported devices are never queried and never appear as smoke
detectors.

Leak detectors and thermostats are served by Resideo's separate Honeywell Home
developer API (`api.honeywellhome.com`), which has live `waterLeakDetectors`,
`thermostats` and `shutoffvalve` endpoints. That API uses its own OAuth
registration, so supporting those devices means a separate integration rather
than an extension of this one.

## The wider Resideo API surface

This integration only uses `ris-public-api`, but the mobile app talks to more
than that. Knowing the rest is useful when diagnosing an outage, because it
tells you whether a problem is specific to us or Resideo wide.

| Surface | Base | Used for |
|---------|------|----------|
| Auth | `login.resideo.com` | Auth0 login and token refresh |
| REST | `api.ha.resideo.com/ris-public-api` | Account listing and smoke detector state, what this integration uses |
| REST | `api.ha.resideo.com` (`devsrv`'s old routes) | Device state and commands, needs an Azure APIM subscription key header |
| Push | `api.ha.resideo.com/ds-notification-service` | Azure SignalR real time events |

`api.resideo.com` — the host all three REST/push rows above used to live under
— was retired around Sept 2026; see "Moved in Sept 2026" above. The `devsrv`
service and the SignalR channel were mapped by the
[sfcodes/ha-resideo](https://github.com/sfcodes/ha-resideo) project, which
documents the APIM key and the SignalR handshake in detail, including that
`devsrv`'s routes were split across the new host's `ris-public-api` v1/v2
paths rather than kept as a separate standalone service.

### Telling an outage apart from a retirement

The gateway answers differently depending on whether a route exists, which
usually makes diagnosis easy without any credentials — **with one important
exception, learned the hard way during the Sept 2026 host move below.**

- `{"statusCode":404,"message":"Resource not found"}` means the **path is not
  registered**. Made up paths look like this.
- `{"statusCode":503,"message":"The API is temporarily down for planned
  maintenance..."}` normally means the **route exists** but its backend is
  flagged down temporarily.

That second rule turned out not to be reliable. Starting 2026-09-09,
`api.resideo.com` returned that exact 503 on every call, indefinitely, for
every client, with no real maintenance window behind it — the host had been
retired, not temporarily downed, but the gateway kept answering as if it were
a transient outage rather than 404ing or reporting the move. **A persistent
503 that doesn't clear after a reasonable window is worth checking for a
retired/moved host, not just waiting out.**

Two more things worth knowing during an outage.

- The push channel and the REST services fail independently. On 2026-09-09 both
  REST services returned 503 for over ten hours while SignalR stayed up, so the
  mobile app still showed live alarm events from its push feed on top of a
  cached device list. An app that looks healthy does **not** mean the REST API
  is healthy.
- The 503 is identical for every client. It does not vary by user agent, by
  whether a bearer token is sent, or by which of the two REST services is
  called, so it is not the integration being singled out.

## Home Assistant Integration Notes

### Sensors to Expose

1. **Binary Sensors:**
   - Smoke Alarm (`alarmState.smoke.deviceState` != "idle")
   - CO Alarm (`alarmState.co.deviceState` != "idle")
   - Malfunction (`alarmState.malfunction.deviceState` != "none")
   - Online Status (`isOnline`)

2. **Sensors:**
   - Battery Status (`alarmState.battery.deviceState`)
   - Power Source (`alarmState.power.deviceState`)
   - WiFi Signal Strength (`deviceStatus.rssi`)
   - Last Message Time (`lastMessageReceivedTime`)

3. **Diagnostic Sensors:**
   - Firmware versions
   - End of Life status
   - Various fault flags

### Polling Interval

Recommend polling every 30-60 seconds. The device reports timestamps in `tStampEpoch` format.

### OAuth Flow for Home Assistant

For Home Assistant, you'll need to implement the full OAuth PKCE flow:
1. Generate code_verifier and code_challenge
2. Open browser to authorization URL
3. Handle callback with authorization code
4. Exchange code for tokens
5. Store and refresh tokens as needed

---

## Example Python Client

```python
import requests

class ResideoClient:
    def __init__(self, refresh_token: str):
        self.client_id = "SRmiA7CaYi1JgivDZdzzoZu4X5VBogGt"
        self.refresh_token = refresh_token
        self.access_token = None

    def _refresh_access_token(self):
        resp = requests.post(
            "https://login.resideo.com/oauth/token",
            json={
                "grant_type": "refresh_token",
                "refresh_token": self.refresh_token,
                "client_id": self.client_id
            }
        )
        data = resp.json()
        self.access_token = data["access_token"]
        return self.access_token

    def _headers(self):
        if not self.access_token:
            self._refresh_access_token()
        return {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.access_token}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }

    def get_accounts(self):
        resp = requests.get(
            "https://api.ha.resideo.com/ris-public-api/api/v1/accounts",
            headers=self._headers()
        )
        return resp.json()

    def get_device_state(self, device_id: str):
        resp = requests.get(
            f"https://api.ha.resideo.com/ris-public-api/api/v2/devices/smokeDetectors/{device_id}/state",
            headers=self._headers()
        )
        return resp.json()

# Usage
client = ResideoClient(refresh_token="your_refresh_token")
accounts = client.get_accounts()
state = client.get_device_state("YOUR_DEVICE_ID")
print(f"Smoke: {state['deviceState']['reported']['alarmState']['smoke']['deviceState']}")
print(f"CO: {state['deviceState']['reported']['alarmState']['co']['deviceState']}")
print(f"Battery: {state['deviceState']['reported']['alarmState']['battery']['deviceState']}")
```
